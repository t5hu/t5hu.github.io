	  I like probability & statistics and more generally mathematics for two reasons: 1) It is such a language that describes phenomena in an elegant way. I’d like to gain the maturity of reading and writing in mathematics, and thus be able to communicate in the mathematical community full of abstraction, analysis and imagination about the real world. 2) It is a powerful tool used in academic as well as industrial fields, allowing me to play in everyone’s backyard. Machine learning, giving computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed, has been applied in numerous areas in the past decade. Expressing a problem in statistical language and designing frameworks based on experiment analysis and intuition seems to be a fun job to me. My interests lie in both applying Prob/Stats/ML, especially in biomedical informatics & bioinformatics, and their theoretical nature.

	    An obvious practical difficulty is that biological questions are explanatory in nature, asking how and why things are the way they are, but statistics is for the most part descriptive. I am interested in developing analysis patterns for genomic data that bridge the gap between description and explanation. I'm currently focused on spatial transcriptomics and behavioral genomics, and I've also worked on:
