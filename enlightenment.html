		Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.<br>
 	        <em>Bertrand Russell</em>.
	      </Li>
	      <li>
		The steps you take don't have to be big, they just need to take you in the right direction.<br>
		<em>Jemma Simmons, Agents of Shield</em>.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		I WILL ATTEND TO my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard.<br>
		<em>JDeclaration of Geneva</em>.
