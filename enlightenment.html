		Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.<br>
 	        <em>Bertrand Russell</em>.
	      </Li>
	      <Li>
		The purpose of mathematics really is to communicate ideas and concepts in a very precise way, and to strip out the essence of what is the real problem at hand. // If you have a mathematical mindset, you can gain some confidence that something you donâ€™t understand, like how a cell phone works or how computer works or how the internet works or how an economy works. It gives you enough tools that you can feel like if you really had to, you can actually understand from first principles, how these things actually work, and the world somehow becomes a less scary place.<br>
		<em>Terence Tao</em>.

	      <li>
		The steps you take don't have to be big, they just need to take you in the right direction.<br>
		<em>Jemma Simmons, Agents of Shield</em>.

	      <li>
		I will attend to my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard.<br>
		<em>Declaration of Geneva</em>.
