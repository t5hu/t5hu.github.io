	  I have taught several different topics to students with varied backgrounds:
	  <ul>
	    <li>STAT 212: A first course in biostatistics for undergraduates</li>
	    <li>STAT 430: Data analysis for senior undergraduates and masters</li>
	    <li>STAT 434: Survival analysis for graduates and advanced undergraduates</li>
	    <li>STAT 530: Bioinformatics for masters and PhDs</li>
	    <li>STAT 578: Topics courses for statistics PhDs</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>
	    I've noticed that many of my students have trouble understanding how the topics they learn are connected. To address this issue, I am interested in how to teach statistics by helping students to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)">construct concepts and methods for themselves</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    One common disconnect is between statistics and data analysis. My students tend to have trouble analyzing data to answer a substantive question, even after they have learned the necessary statistical methods. I am interested in showing how conceptual problems in data analysis actually lead naturally to the development of statistical ideas. Here are slides from my latest attempt, from a two-hour short course on statistics that I teach each summer as part of the <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/compgenomicscourse/">Mayo Clinic and Illinois Alliance Computational Genomics Course</a>:

	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Another common disconnect is between different statistical methods. My students have trouble seeing that standard procedures are all based on the same core set of statistical and probabilistic principles. I am interested in how to teach students to start from these core principles to <a href="https://digital.archives.caltech.edu/islandora/object/image%3A2545">create and understand</a> standard procedures.

	    Finally, I am interested in how to teach PhD students to do research. I encourage all of my students to read <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Rants/AdviceGS.html">this</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29716076">this</a>, and so far have been fortunate to advise:
